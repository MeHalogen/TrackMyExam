## Features Currently Hidden:

### 1. "Create Your Dashboard" Button

### 2. Timeline Coverage Stat
- **Location**: Hero stats section (index.html)
- **Display**: "Oct 25 - Jul 26 / Timeline Coverage"
- **Code Status**: Commented out in HTML

- **Future Use**: Can be shown in a more detailed statistics page

### 3. Days Until First Deadline Tile
- **Location**: Hero stats section (index.html)
- **Display**: Countdown to first upcoming deadline
- **Code Status**: Commented out in HTML and JavaScript (app.js - updateDaysUntilFirst function)

- **Future Use**: Could be part of a personalized dashboard

### 4. Urgent Deadlines Section
- **Location**: Below hero section (index.html)

- **Code Status**:

- **Reason for Hiding**: 
  - Simplifying initial version
